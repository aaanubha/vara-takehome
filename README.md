# vara-takehome

This repo contains the code for the vara take home full stack coding assignment. 

# Here, I have implemented the following
- Accessing data file
- Pasting the xlsx file
- Performing transpositions necessary to plot
- Plotting a interactive chart

# Alternatives
- Another alternative plan of action was to have an upload button, the code for which is present in the repo, through which the user can upload their excel file and plot their data. 

# Scope for improvement:
- In the future, I can try and implement various other charts on the data as well, with different pages for each chart.
- There can be scope to edit the data as well.
